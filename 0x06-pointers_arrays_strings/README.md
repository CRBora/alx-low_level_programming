0x06. C - More pointers, arrays and strings

0. strcat - Write a function that concatenates two strings.
1. strncat - Write a function that concatenates two strings except that
it will use at most n bytes from src; and
src does not need to be null-terminated if it contains n or more bytes
2. strncpy - Write a function that copies a string.
3. strcmp - Write a function that compares two strings.
4. I am a kind of paranoid in reverse. I suspect people of plotting to make me happy - Write a function that reverses the content of an array of integers.
5. Always look up - Write a function that changes all lowercase letters of a string to uppercase.
6. Expect the best. Prepare for the worst. Capitalize on what comes - Write a function that capitalizes all words of a string.
7. Mozart composed his music not for the elite, but for everybody - Write a function that encodes a string into 1337.

Letters a and A should be replaced by 4
Letters e and E should be replaced by 3
Letters o and O should be replaced by 0
Letters t and T should be replaced by 7

Prototype: char *leet(char *);
You can only use one if in your code
You can only use two loops in your code
You are not allowed to use switch
You are not allowed to use any ternary operation
8. rot13 - Write a function that encodes a string using rot13.
9. Numbers have life; they're not just symbols on paper - Write a function that prints an integer.
10. A dream doesn't become reality through magic; it takes sweat, determination and hard work - Add one line to this code, so that the program prints a[2] = 98, followed by a new line.
11. It is the addition of strangeness to beauty that constitutes the romantic character in art - Write a function that adds two numbers.

Prototype: char *infinite_add(char *n1, char *n2, char *r, int size_r);
Where n1 and n2 are the two numbers
r is the buffer that the function will use to store the result
size_r is the buffer size
The function returns a pointer to the result
You can assume that you will always get positive numbers, or 0
You can assume that there will be only digits in the strings n1 and n2
n1 and n2 will never be empty
If the result can not be stored in r the function must return 0
12. Noise is a buffer, more effective than cubicles or booth walls - Write a function that prints a buffer.
